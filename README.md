## Description
This is my portfolio that is going to hold all of my future projects. Here are some of the steps that I took to get the page how it is:
- I began by building a basic html structure that included the key headings and sections that I would need for my portfolio.
- Next I made sure that the nav links all worked and brought the page to the correct section.
- Once all the necessary content was in the heading I began stylying it in CSS to make sure everything looked correct.
- I also assigned colors to variables so that they were easier to reference through CSS.
- Next I started making divs and sections all through out the HTML so that some things would appear as columns and some things would appear and rows. 
- From here on out I just played with CSS until the page looked the way I needed it to.
